<title>How to install Debian 12 | FrDomains</title>

<p><strong>1: Downloading</strong></p>
<p>To install Debian, you will need to have an ISO file and flash it onto a drive (USB Drive, Flash Drive).</p>
<p>You can choose different flavors of Debian, (Ubuntu, Pop!_OS, Linux Mint, RPI OS) but in this tutorial we will install Debian itself.</p>
<p>Download the Debian ISO <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://debian.org/">here.</a></p>
<p>If you want to install a different Debian-based system, we have a list of downloads to those&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/tutorials/debian-install/distros">here.</a></p>
<p><strong>2: Flashing it onto a drive</strong></p>
<p>Now, locate the ISO file you downloaded earlier. Now, open&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rufus.ie">rufus.ie</a>&nbsp;and download Rufus.</p>
<p>After that, open rufus. You will have a list of options.</p>
<p><img src="/tutorials/debian-install/images/rufus.png" alt="rufus" width="324" height="368"></p>
<p>Select the ISO image and your USB Drive and click Start.</p>
<p><strong>3: Booting</strong></p>
<p>After flashing, you'll need to boot from the USB.</p>
<p>Each Motherboard manufacturer has its own key for the boot menu.</p>
<p>You can search for your motherboard manufacturer's boot menu key on Google. We will put here a list of keys.</p>
<p>Dell: F12</p>
<p>HP: ESC</p>
<p>ASUS (and a lot of other brands): Delete</p>
<p><strong>4: Installing</strong></p>
<p>Install Debian by using arrow keys and&nbsp;highlighting Install and clicking enter.</p>

<p>Select your keyboard layout.</p>
<p><img class="image_resized" src="/tutorials/debian-install/images/layout.png" alt="layout"></p>
<p>Choose your hostname. (that will appear in the router settings and in the terminal (username@hostname:~ $))</p>

<p>On the domain name, just press enter.</p>
<p>On root password, press enter too.</p>

<p>Now, enter the username for the new user. You can put the same, but with small letters. That will appear as username@hostname:~ $ in the terminal.</p>
<p>Choose a password for your user account.</p>
<p>Select your time zone.</p>
<p>If you want to use the entire disk, choose Guided - use entire disk (as the name says :D)</p>
<p>Select your disk and All files in one partition. Finish partitioning and write changes to disk. Choose Yes. Now you wait, this shouldn't take long.</p>
<p>If the package manager asks if you want to install something from the USB, say no.</p>
<p>Choose your country again. (the download servers for the package manager)</p>
<p>Leave the proxy blank. (if you don't have one)</p>
<p>Wait again.</p>
<p>Now, say no to not send the data with the most used packages on the system.</p>
<p>Now, choose the Apps you want to install. If you want to use your Debian system personally, use this configuration:</p>
